1. The first step is to create a wishlist that can be accessed via the 'heart' icon at the top right corner of the IKEA webpage.
2. Either build your wishlist or select the one that you've already got.
3. You can also build a wishlist on the fly by simply clicking on the 'heart' icon that floats above each desired-product image as you hover over it.
4. Once you are in your wishlist, you can see that your desired products are listed vertically. 
5. Right click on the page and select 'Print Page...', or use 'File... Print...' to bring up the Print Dialogue. 
   Make sure you choose 'Save as PDF' in the dropdown, and voila!
6. Locate the wishlist PDF that you've just saved and upload it to the upload container in this app.
7. Make sure that the language of your PDF matches the language that you've selected, and that the car model has been selected.
8. Will It Fit? Click 'Generate' to find out.
9. Optionally, if your car has movable back-seats, check the tickbox to reveal that extra space, and hit 'Generate'.
